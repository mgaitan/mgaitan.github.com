# Nikola is multilingual!
#
# Currently supported languages are:
# bg     Bulgarian
# ca     Catalan
# de     German
# el     Greek [NOT gr!]
# en     English
# eo     Esperanto
# es     Spanish
# fa     Persian
# fi     Finnish
# fr     French
# hr     Croatian
# it     Italian
# jp     Japanese
# nl     Dutch
# pt_br  Portuguese (Brasil)
# pl     Polish
# ru     Russian
# sl     Slovenian [NOT sl_si!]
# tr_tr  Turkish (Turkey)
# zh_cn  Chinese (Simplified)
#
# If you want to use Nikola with a non-supported language you have to provide
# a module containing the necessary translations
# (p.e. look at the modules at: ./nikola/data/themes/default/messages/fr.py).
# If a specific post is not translated to a language, then the version
# in the default language will be shown instead.

# What is the default language?
DEFAULT_LANG = "es"

# What other languages do you have?
# The format is {"translationcode" : "path/to/translation" }
# the path will be used as a prefix for the generated pages location
TRANSLATIONS = {
    DEFAULT_LANG: "",
    # Example for another language:
    # "es": "./es",
}

# Links for the sidebar / navigation bar.
# You should provide a key-value pair for each used language.
NAVIGATION_LINKS = {

        ('/archive.html', 'Archives'),
        ('/categories/index.html', 'Tags'),

    ),
}

# Below this point, everything is optional

# While nikola can select a sensible locale for each language,
# sometimes explicit control can come handy.
# In this file we express locales in the string form that
# python's locales will accept in your OS, by example
# "en_US.utf8" in unix-like OS, "English_United States" in Windows.
# LOCALES = dict mapping language --> explicit locale for the languages
# in TRANSLATIONS. You can ommit one or more keys.
# LOCALE_FALLBACK = locale to use when an explicit locale is unavailable
# LOCALE_DEFAULT = locale to use for languages not mentioned in LOCALES; if
# not set the default Nikola mapping is used.

# POSTS and PAGES contains (wildcard, destination, template) tuples.
#
# The wildcard is used to generate a list of reSt source files
# (whatever/thing.txt).
# That fragment must have an associated metadata file (whatever/thing.meta),
# and opcionally translated files (example for spanish, with code "es"):
#     whatever/thing.txt.es and whatever/thing.meta.es
#
# From those files, a set of HTML fragment files will be generated:
# cache/whatever/thing.html (and maybe cache/whatever/thing.html.es)
#
# These files are combinated with the template to produce rendered
# pages, which will be placed at
# output / TRANSLATIONS[lang] / destination / pagename.html
#
# where "pagename" is specified in the metadata file.
#
# if use_in_feed is True, then those posts will be added to the site's
# rss feeds.
